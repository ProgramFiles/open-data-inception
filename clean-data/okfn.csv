All citizens have the right to access to this information, that can assist in controlling public expenditure, commenting, questioning, promoting and overseeing the spending of public institutions.

The state spends thousands of dollars on new technology platforms that enhance and facilitate the collection of revenue, however, regarding the provision of information on public institutions, their assets and expenditure, there is little information that is dispersed , poorly organized and difficult to access.

Transparency and easy access to information is the first instrument in fighting corruption, so do not understand why there is so much reluctance in most public institutions in providing this information.

It is intended that this project is a platform informative and useful to society. Not wanting to be sensationalist, or party, it is expected that citizens and different stakeholders see it as a support for growth of the country, citizen participation and fair competition in the supply of goods / services to the public sector.

The collection of this information is not always a simple process, and sometimes this is not 100% correct, so it's up to all of us proceed to its validation and require the institutions to provide increasingly, information and more accurate.

At this point is to collect through the site settings Direct base.gov.pt and enterprise data through the site publicações.mj.pt . Advantage has been taken to treat and store the information collected in a structured way, to be able to cross data from different sources. At present we can see, for example, adjustments were made ​​directly to the companies newly established . This functionality can be seen that some results are obtained very curious and dubious.

Usaspending.gov,http://usaspending.gov/,Us Government,"The Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act (FFATA) of 2006, full text of the Transparency Act ( ), requires that the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) establish a single searchable website, accessible to the public at no cost, which includes for each Federal award:

the name of the entity receiving the award;
the amount of the award;
information on the award including transaction type, funding agency, etc;
the location of the entity receiving the award; and
a unique identifier of the entity receiving the award.
USAspending.gov was first launched in December 2007 to fulfill these requirements. Prime award information shown on the website is provided by Federal Agencies through four main source systems (see Sources of Data). USAspending.gov receives and displays data pertaining to obligations (amounts awarded for federally sponsored projects during a given budget period), not outlays or expenditures (actual cash disbursements made against each project). Read the latest OMB-issued memoranda M-09-19, ""Guidance on Data Submission under the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act"" ( ) as it provides guidance to agencies on how to report information to USAspending.gov.

USAspending.gov has been recently updated in October 2010 to display of first-tier sub-award data (subcontracts and subgrants). Sub-award information shown on the website is provided by FSRS (see Sources of Data). The latest guidance documents pertaining to sub-award reporting can be found under News.","39.76,-98.5",39.76,-98.5
